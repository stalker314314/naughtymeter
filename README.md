# naughtymeter
Android app that measures if kids were naughty or nice.

App is scraped together really quick to do single job - entertain our own kids.
Idea is that Santa Claus have tablet/phone that has this app and can detect how each child behaved in current year.

App has sending part where one parent (while no one is watching) is sending signals to gaugemeter.
Receiving part is gaugemeter that shows some values and flash when 100% is reached (which should be always).
Other parent is useful, as Santa can talk with a kid, can pull his nose up and down.

For maximum effect, have some Santa Claus Hat with glued wires that are connected
to your tablet/phone and pretend you get signal from there.
